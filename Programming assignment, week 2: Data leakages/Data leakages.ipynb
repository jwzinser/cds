    "The incidence matrix is a matrix of size `(maxId + 1, maxId + 1)`, where each row (column) `i` corresponds `i-th` `Id`. In this matrix we put the value `1` to the position `[i, j]`, if and only if a pair `(i, j)` or `(j, i)` is present in  a given set of pais `(FirstId, SecondId)`. All the other elements in the incidence matrix are zeros.   \n",

At the same time incidence matrices are usually huge in terms of total number of elements, and it is **impossible to store them in memory in dense format**. But due to their sparsity incidence matrices **can be easily represented as sparse matrices**. If you are not familiar with sparse matrices, please see [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_matrix) and [scipy.sparse reference](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/sparse.html). Please, use any of `scipy.sparse` constructors to build incidence matrix. \n",

We highly recommend to learn to use different `scipy.sparse` constuctors, and matrices types, but if you feel you don't want to use them, you can always build this matrix with a simple `for` loop. You will need first to create a matrix using `scipy.sparse.coo_matrix((M, N), [dtype])` with an appropriate shape `(M, N)` and then iterate through `(FirstId, SecondId)` pairs and fill corresponding elements in matrix with ones. \n",

       "    - facilitates fast conversion among sparse formats\n",

       "Intended Usage\n",
       "    - COO is a fast format for constructing sparse matrices\n",
       "    - Once a matrix has been constructed, convert to CSR or\n",
       "      CSC format for fast arithmetic and matrix vector operations\n",
       "    - By default when converting to CSR or CSC format, duplicate (i,j)\n",
